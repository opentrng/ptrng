## Allan variance

You can compute the Allan Variance for a ring-oscillator time serie, whether it's obtained from measurement or from emulation. The Python script `allanvariance.py` can plot the normalized Allan Variance versus samples accumulation. For instance, you can use the following command to plot the Allan Variance of an emulated ring-oscillator:

```
$ python allan_variance.py -t "Plot title" ro.txt allanvar.png
```

Please note that the Allan variance can also be plotted for the COSO counter values to estimate thermal and flicker noise contributions.

## COSO counter distribution

You can visualize the counter values generated by the Coherent Sampling Ring Oscillator (COSO), whether emulated or obtained from the FPGA board, by creating a histogram using the Python script `distribution.py`.

```
$ python distribution.py --log -t "Plot title" coso.txt distribution.png
```

The provided example illustrates the generation of a COSO log-distribution plot using data from produced through emulator of two ring-oscillators at 500MHz and 505MHz.

## Entropy estimation

Entropy estimators take binary files as input. The script `tobinary.py` can be used to convert ERO, MURO and COSO output files to binary. This script takes one integer per line (value should be 0, 1 or n), then extracts the less significant bit (LSB) and pack successive bits to bytes.

You can estimate entropy of the generated binary streams with the script `entropy.py` and different estimators:
* Shannon entropy ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)))
* Most Common Value (from [NIST SP800-90B](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/90/b/final))
* Markov (from [NIST SP800-90B](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/90/b/final))
* T8 from [BSI AIS 20/31](https://www.bsi.bund.de/dok/randomnumbergenerators) test procedure B

Estimators can be computed for different samples size from 1 to 32 bits.

```
$ python entropy.py -b 8 mcv ero.bin
```

The provided example computes the MCV estimator on 8 bits samples read from the `ero.bin` binary file.

## Auto-correlation

The Python script `autocorrelation.py` plots the autocorrelation for a random binary file, read by words of `b` bits. The `d` parameter limits the maximum lag (depth) of the signal correlation with itself.

```
$ python autocorrelation.py -b 8 -d 100 -t "Plot title" coso.bin autocorr.png
```

This example plots the correlation of the signal with itself in a maximum lag of 100 samples of 8 bits each.
