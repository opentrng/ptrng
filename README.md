# OpenTRNG

Welcome to **OpenTRNG**, the open-source framework for True Random Number Generators! ðŸŽ²

This project provides the community with reference implementations of Physical TRNGs (PTRNGs) based on ring oscillators, designed to be transparent, reproducible, and easy to experiment with.

With **OpenTRNG**, you can:

1. [Emulate](https://opentrng.org/docs/emulator) noisy ring oscillators
2. [Emulate](https://opentrng.org/docs/emulator) raw random number
3. [Simulate, compile](https://opentrng.org/docs/hardware) and [run](https://opentrng.org/docs/remote) the PTRNG on FPGA
4. [Analyze and evaluate](https://opentrng.org/docs/analyze) the random outcomes

Find more about OpenTRNG on [opentrng.org](https://opentrng.org) and read the [documentation](https://opentrng.org/docs).

> [!WARNING]
> The OpenTRNG project provides reference TRNG/PTRNG implementations as described in scientific literature. The source code is released for academic and research purposes only. Compliance with verification or certification standards is not guaranteed, and the code must not be used as is in products. Any misuse or unintended application is beyond the responsibility of CEA.
