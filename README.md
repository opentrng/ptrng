# OpenTRNG

Welcome to **OpenTRNG**, the open-source TRNG! This project is dedicated to delivering the community open-source implementations of reference Physical True Random Number Generator (TRNG or PTRNG) based on ring oscillators. Through **OpenTRNG**, you have the ability to:

1. [Emulate](https://opentrng.org/docs/emulator) noisy ring oscillators
2. [Emulate](https://opentrng.org/docs/emulator) raw random number
3. [Simulate, compile](https://opentrng.org/docs/hardware) and [run](https://opentrng.org/docs/remote) the PTRNG on FPGA
4. [Analyze and evaluate](https://opentrng.org/docs/analyze) the random outcomes

Find more about OpenTRNG on [opentrng.org](https://opentrng.org) and read the [documentation](https://opentrng.org/docs).

> [!WARNING]
> The **OpenTRNG** project implements reference TRNG or PTRNG implementations as found in the scientific litterature, the source code is made available for accademic purposes only. As compliance with verification and certification standards cannot be guarantee, it shall not be deployed "as is" in a product. Please be aware that any misuse or unintended application of this project is beyond the responsibility of CEA. If you plan to integrate a Random Number Generator (RNG) into a product, feel free to [contact us](https://opentrng.org/contact).
